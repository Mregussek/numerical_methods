# Numerical Methods

This repository is used to store code from course Computational Techniques, which I took at my university. Here you can find some of interpolation, approximation methods or numerical integration. 

## Usage

I tested this code using [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) and [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). It is your choice, which program you are going to use.
